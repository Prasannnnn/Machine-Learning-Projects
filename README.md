Emoji using face emotion based machine learning in this the dataset link is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uEwn0LvNhlI1ac423jCQV8vYccpTQtl5?usp=drive_link this will get all the 
zip files and the data with images.
This project will be implemented in two parts:
-->Building an image classification model which can classify facial images with different expressions on them.
-->Extracting the face from an image and then classifying the expression on it using the classifier.

Modules Used
Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.

Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
Matplotlib – This library is used to draw visualizations.
Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
OpenCV – This is an open-source library mainly focused on image processing and handling.
Tensorflow – This is an open-source library that is used for Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence and provides a range of functions to achieve complex functionalities with single lines of code.
